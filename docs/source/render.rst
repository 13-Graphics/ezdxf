Rendering
=========

The `render` subpackage provides helpful utilities to create complex forms, but `ezdxf` is still not a rendering
engine in the sense of true graphical rendering for screen or paper.

    - create complex meshes for the :class:`Mesh` entity.
    - render complex curves like bezier curves, euler spirals or splines as :class:`Polyline` entity
    - vertex generators for simple and complex forms like circle, ellipse or euler spiral
